# HDR and high-precision color

HDR is an opt-in streaming mode in the Qt/native client. It is separate from the existing color-quality setting: a 10-bit SDR stream is still SDR. Enable HDR in the operating system first, then enable **HDR** in OpenNOW's stream settings before starting a new session. The remote game and GeForce NOW service must also allow HDR.

## Supported paths

| Platform | Decode and conversion | Window output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Media Foundation hardware HEVC/AV1 P010 with D3D11 video processing, or HEVC Y410 with ten-bit UINT shader conversion. Both retain PQ BT.2020 in RGB10A2. | Linear extended sRGB (scRGB) is preferred; HDR10 is available when the window supports it. |
| macOS | Hardware VideoToolbox HEVC Main10 with a verified PQ decode and IOSurface-to-Metal conversion. Encoded PQ BT.2020 is retained in RGBA16F. | Metal extended-range output; current display headroom and Qt's display-referred luminance contract determine HDR presentation. |
| Linux | An attached Vulkan Video device supporting the negotiated 10-bit profile, or FFmpeg VAAPI with a verified HEVC Main10/AV1 10-bit profile and supported P010 DMA-BUF import. | A single-screen Wayland desktop with a complete configured PQ output description and HDR target headroom through `color-management-v1`, plus a Vulkan surface exposing scRGB or HDR10. |

H.264, software decoding, CUDA's CPU-download presentation path, and standalone native presenter windows do not support HDR. The application does not enable HDR on an SDR-only desktop or assume that X11 supports it. Linux DMA-BUF layouts requiring disjoint multi-object image import are rejected rather than copied to the CPU.

Linux output detection deliberately remains SDR on X11, multiple-screen configurations,
missing color-management support, ICC-only descriptions, and incomplete or ambiguous output
metadata. Advertised Vulkan HDR formats and compositor preferred-image hints alone are not
evidence that the output is currently HDR. Output changes invalidate previous readiness;
incomplete protocol replies are bounded and retried rather than reused as stale HDR support.

Frame generation is disabled for HDR sources because the current interpolation path is designed for SDR. Native frames retain their original cadence and HDR precision; enabling HDR does not insert SDR-generated frames into the stream.

HDR requests use ten bits and preserve the selected chroma format. Auto prefers HEVC and falls back to AV1 for 4:2:0 only when the runtime reports the required hardware support. HDR 4:4:4 requires HEVC and a supported ten-bit 4:4:4 decode and conversion path. Explicit incompatible codecs or unavailable output produce an actionable error before allocating a new session. An explicit server SDR response remains SDR; a saved HDR preference does not override the accepted session format.

## 10-bit 4:4:4

Ten-bit 4:4:4 does not imply HDR. Select Auto or HEVC;
the supported GFN request policy does not request AV1 4:4:4. Explicit incompatible codec
choices fail before session allocation instead of silently reducing chroma. Enabling HDR
preserves 4:4:4 and promotes an eight-bit selection to ten bits for that session without rewriting the saved SDR preference.

- Linux uses the attached Vulkan Video device's exact HEVC range-extension profile and P410
  output layout, then retains full-resolution chroma in GPU snapshots and conversion. CUDA,
  VAAPI DMA-BUF, and CPU conversion do not provide this 4:4:4 path.
- macOS requests VideoToolbox x444 output only after a hardware-required Main44410 fixture
  decodes and completes Metal conversion. A codec-wide HEVC capability is not sufficient.
- Windows advertises 4:4:4 only if an installed hardware MFT decodes the corresponding
  AYUV/Y410 fixture and the embedded GPU converter processes the actual output. Y410 SDR
  uses exact ten-bit UINT shader conversion because the video processor on the tested
  RTX 3080 applied eight-bit-normalized range offsets. Older
  decoder documentation describes only Main/Main10 4:2:0, but the installed
  `HEVCVideoExtension` on an RTX 3080 successfully decoded the Main44410 fixture through
  D3D11 during validation. D3D12-on-11 profile availability differed on that same device.
  Neither a codec-wide capability nor the GPU model substitutes for the exact runtime probe;
  an installed decoder that cannot expose the profile remains unsupported.
  HDR Y410 has a separate PQ fixture probe and uses the BT.2020 conversion matrix while
  preserving PQ code values for Qt's HDR output conversion.

Platform profile and conversion tests are not evidence of a successful GFN session or an HDR
display's output. The exact GPU, driver, decoder, service tier, and compositor must support
the requested mode. Unsupported profiles remain explicit errors rather than CPU fallbacks.

## Color and ownership contract

CloudMatch receives `sdrHdrMode=1` for native HDR and `trueHdr=false`. TrueHDR requests a separate server-side AI SDR-to-HDR filter, which OpenNOW does not offer. SDR requests send `displayData:null`. HDR requests include measured output luminance when a validated snapshot is available, or requested-content defaults of 1000 nits maximum, 400 nits frame average, and zero minimum. A complete, validated runtime metadata group can additionally supply maximum full-frame luminance and display primaries and white point. Missing or invalid optional metadata is omitted rather than inferred. The luminance defaults are not physical-display measurements. Wayland color-management continues to supply only its target luminance pair: its PQ description does not establish a display peak from primary color volume luminance or expose a sustained full-frame value. The accepted HDR mode is carried through resume, stream preparation, and NVST's dynamic-range and bit-depth settings.

Decoder metadata carries transfer function, primaries, matrix, range, and supported chroma location. Explicit metadata takes precedence over negotiated defaults; unspecified fields use those defaults. Unsupported combinations and precision-losing paths fail explicitly. Pixel depth alone never selects an HDR transfer function.

The texture format and encoded RGB color space are separate fields introduced in FFI ABI 6 and retained in later ABI releases. Windows publishes PQ BT.2020 in RGB10A2; Linux preserves PQ/HLG BT.2020 in RGBA16F. Qt performs the transfer-function and gamut conversion for the actual output. HDR/SDR changes retain per-frame metadata and bounded GPU resource ownership. Build and deploy the Qt shell and native streamer together; an older ABI is rejected.

Ten-bit SDR is preserved independently: Windows, Linux, and macOS publish RGB10A2 for supported ten-bit SDR decode instead of first reducing it to RGBA8. When the final Qt output is eight-bit SDR, ordered dithering is applied after color conversion and any HDR-to-SDR tone mapping. Linear HDR output is neither SDR-clamped nor eight-bit dithered.

The existing `StreamVideoItem`, stream transport, and input owner remain active under menus, statistics, and exit confirmation. Losing HDR output uses explicit SDR tone mapping instead of reinterpreting PQ values as SDR. No CPU video readback is introduced for HDR presentation.

SDR chrome is converted to the output's linear white level before blending. scRGB uses direct scene composition. HDR10-only outputs require one bounded, window-sized RGBA16F GPU composition target and a final PQ-encoding pass, so translucent chrome blends in linear light rather than averaging PQ code values. This adds GPU bandwidth only on the HDR10 output path; it does not create another window or decoder.

## Hardware acceptance

Automated shader and native tests cannot prove an HDR monitor's optical output. Test the packaged build, rather than mixing a new shell with an older native runtime.

1. Enable HDR in the OS and confirm that OpenNOW reports an available HDR output. Start an HDR-capable game with HDR enabled, Auto codec, and the normal native backend. Verify that in-game HDR controls become available and highlights extend beyond SDR white without lifting black levels or washing out colors.
2. Repeat with explicit HEVC and AV1 where the GPU supports each codec. Confirm that an H.264 or software override produces an error rather than a falsely labeled HDR stream. Disable HDR and confirm that ordinary 8-bit and 10-bit SDR sessions retain their previous appearance.
3. Test windowed and fullscreen modes, resizing, and DPI changes. Open and close F3 statistics, the stream menu, and exit confirmation. Check text brightness, translucent edges, black backgrounds, pointer confinement, gameplay key routing, and uninterrupted audio/video.
4. Move the active stream between HDR and SDR displays and toggle OS HDR. Verify deliberate SDR tone mapping on an SDR output, recovery when HDR returns, and no session restart. Repeat with overlays open.
5. End the session and start another with the opposite HDR setting, then exercise reconnect/resume. Verify that the new or accepted session's color mode wins over stale frame textures and saved preferences.
6. On Linux, test Vulkan Video and VAAPI separately when available. Check diagnostics for explicit import/decoder failures; audio continuing alone does not prove video health.
7. Select HEVC, 10-bit 4:4:4, and HDR. Verify that the accepted session and decoded frames retain ten-bit 4:4:4 and PQ BT.2020, then check saturated colors and highlights in the game. Reconnect and resume with saved settings changed to SDR 4:2:0; the accepted HDR 4:4:4 profile must still win. Repeat the window, overlay, and display-transition checks above. An unsupported decoder must fail explicitly rather than reduce chroma or copy frames to the CPU.

When reporting a failure, include the OS/compositor, GPU and driver, display model, HDR setting, codec/backend, window mode, and whether the failure occurred during startup, decoding, presentation, or a display transition. Do not share account tokens or session credentials.

Its native renderer was not copied into Qt. Qt's [HDR swapchain formats](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qrhiswapchain.html) and [HDR white-level contract](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qrhiswapchainhdrinfo.html) define the output conversions.
