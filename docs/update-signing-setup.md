# Activate nightly update signing

Publication requires a protected `qt-update-signing` environment and an installed
production key. Each signing job runs separately on `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404`;
no manually registered `opennow-release-signer` is needed. The workflow does not
create the environment, configure its protections, or install a production key.

## Configure the protected signer

1. In the repository's Settings → Environments, create `qt-update-signing`.
2. Enable required reviewers and prevent self-review. Disable administrator bypass
   where the repository plan permits it.
3. Restrict deployment branches and tags to the protected release refs your reviewers
   approve. For nightly dispatches from `dev`, explicitly allow protected `dev`.
   Do not allow unreviewed feature branches or pull-request refs.
4. Enable Blacksmith for this repository and retain the separate signing jobs on
   `blacksmith-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404`. Do not combine signing with platform build or test jobs.
5. Keep signing workspaces uncached. Each signing job checks for Python 3.11 or newer,
   OpenSSL 3, `jq`, and GNU checksum tools before accessing the seed. Do not execute
   candidate programs on the signer. Both jobs have a 30-minute deadline.
6. Retain the existing production Ed25519 key outside CI; do not generate a replacement
   for already deployed clients. Add only its canonical
   base64-encoded 32-byte private seed as the environment secret
   `OPENNOW_UPDATE_ED25519_PRIVATE_KEY`. Do not put the seed in repository secrets,
   workflow inputs, CMake arguments, build artifacts, logs, or a developer message.
7. Use the public key recorded in `opennow-qt/packaging/update-public-key.base64` for dispatches.
   The public key is not secret. The signing job derives it independently from the
   seed and rejects a mismatch.

Environment protections are part of the trust boundary. GitHub can create an environment
name referenced by a workflow without adding protections. Verify the reviewer and ref
rules before the first dispatch; the YAML cannot enforce those server-side settings.
Reviewers must approve the exact dispatched source/workflow revision and inspect its
workflow and packaging/signing scripts before allowing access to the seed. The signer
checks out only that immutable revision, with persisted Git credentials disabled, and
treats downloaded packages as data. Never execute downloaded artifacts or candidate
programs on the signer. Only the approved release tooling may run there.

## Publish the first update-enabled nightly

1. Select the reviewed protected revision in GitHub Actions → qt-ci → Run workflow.
2. Retain the default production `public_key` and set `publish_nightly` to `true`.
3. Wait for shared checks, all platform checks, and the complete package build to pass.
4. Inspect the source commit, eleven packages, and two AppImage sidecars before approving the
   `qt-update-signing` deployment.
5. Confirm that the publisher verifies the signed set and uploads all 28 files before
   making the draft prerelease public. These are eleven packages, two sidecars, thirteen sibling manifests,
   `RELEASE-INFO.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`.

For artifact-only testing, leave `publish_nightly` false. An empty `public_key` is
allowed only for that non-public path. The resulting build cannot download updates
because its signature policy remains `unconfigured-fail-closed`.

Users running an earlier nightly without a pinned key must manually download and
install the first update-enabled nightly once. That older application cannot securely
learn a trust key from release metadata. Do not bypass signature checks to bootstrap it.
Later updates require manifests signed by the already pinned key.

Update-manifest signing does not remove Windows publisher warnings or macOS Gatekeeper
warnings. The platform packages remain unsigned. Nightly release notes use GitHub-generated
changelogs; installation guidance and known limitations are documented in
[`qt-nightly-release.md`](qt-nightly-release.md). Update signing does not fix partner
authentication or streaming compatibility.

## Verify the repository contract without production credentials

Run the packaging and workflow tests:

```sh
python3 -m venv build/icon-tools
build/icon-tools/bin/python -m pip install -r opennow-qt/packaging/icon-requirements.txt
build/icon-tools/bin/python -m unittest discover -s opennow-qt/tests -p 'test_*.py'
actionlint -color=false .github/workflows/qt-ci.yml .github/workflows/qt-checks.yml \
  .github/workflows/qt-build.yml .github/workflows/qt-release-candidate.yml
```

The signing tests generate ephemeral test-only keys, sign and verify all thirteen fixture
nightly assets with OpenSSL. Candidate promotion tests exercise the production candidate's
signing script with fourteen fixture assets. Both reject mismatched keys, incomplete inventories, changed
packages, changed manifests, and invalid public inputs. No production seed is needed.

The platform-check action also runs `opennow-qt/tests/run_update_helper_integration.py`
with `python` on Windows x64 and `python3` on Linux x64 and macOS ARM64. That driver
builds the helper and candidate fixtures in a temporary Cargo target directory and
runs all four signed-helper integration tests with an ephemeral key. It runs only
on platform test workers, never on the protected release signer.
