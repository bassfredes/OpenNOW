# NVB features and control binaries

Byte-verifiable control frames only. Official Geronimo logs name feature types and print a heap pointer for `nvbFeatureControl`, not hex. Type 10 has no captured frame on this machine.

Hex in tests is compact lowercase. The same bytes are also written with spaces so you can count fields.

Source of truth for OpenNOW frames is `control_keepalive_and_activation_are_byte_exact` and the neighboring tests in `native/opennow-streamer/crates/opennow-streamer-transport/src/nvst_input.rs`. QoS and IDR vectors live in `nvst_control.rs`.

## Wire header

Every OpenNOW outbound control frame is

| Offset | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | u16 LE | command code |
| 2 | u16 LE | payload length |
| 4 | bytes | payload |

`0x0308` on the wire is `08 03`. `0x030d` is `0d 03`. Do not read those as big-endian command IDs.

## Official NVB feature types

From `geronimo.log` and `geronimo.log.bak` on this machine. `nvbFeatureControl` only prints a heap pointer such as `000001F167CCC990`. That is not a payload.

| NVB type | Log verb | When | Meaning from surrounding lines | OpenNOW command | Payload in this tree |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Enabled / Disabled | Every cursor-info change. Official then hides the remote cursor. | Server-composited cursor in the video | `0x0308` `COMMAND_MOUSE_CURSOR_CAPTURE` | Known. See below. |
| 6 | Enabled | After `Sending haptics state 1 to server` | Gamepad rumble | `0x0206` remote input, inner type 13 | Little-endian u16 enable flag in the timestamp envelope. See test `transport_control_inputs_do_not_disable_native_input`. |
| 8 | Enabled | Once when the session is ready, with type 0 | Track remote cursor image | `0x030d` `COMMAND_TRACK_REMOTE_CURSOR_IMAGE` | Known. See below. |
| 10 | Update | Next to `Sending SDL mouse settings` or `Sending alt mouse settings (accel=0, speed=10)` | Host mouse accel and speed | none captured | **Not dumped. Do not send a guess.** |

No other feature type numbers appear in these logs.

## Feature frames OpenNOW does send

Proven by `assert_eq!(..., hex(...))` in `nvst_input.rs`.

### `0x0308` mouse cursor capture

NVB type 0. One payload byte. `0` off, `1` on.

```
off  08 03 01 00 00
on   08 03 01 00 01
```

Activation sends **on**. OpenNOW requests **off** after the first cursor notification,
including native bitmap notifications whose pixel layout is not decoded. If the host
publishes no cursor notification, a three-second watchdog requests **off** instead.
Tracking stays enabled so notifications keep arriving. Startup capture/tracking retries
are limited to eight attempts including activation, paced at 250 ms; disabling uses a
separate budget of eight attempts at 250 ms. Failed disable attempts retain the
server-composited state, and exhaustion is logged without retrying indefinitely.

The streamer emits `{"type":"cursor-capture","startId":"…","composited":true}` through its existing
JSON event output on each activation attempt, conservatively covering partially queued
activation chains. It emits `composited:false` only after capture **off** is successfully
queued. This records local command acceptance, not a host acknowledgement. Closing the
reliable control channel cancels the handoff; reactivation resets its deadline and retry
budgets and emits `true` again.

Composition output retains one pending latest state per session and retries a full
bounded event queue without blocking media or input. `startId` identifies the accepted
start command so Qt can reject callbacks from a previous session. Native bitmap
notifications must contain at least their eight-byte header; dedicated cursor-channel
messages must have a supported normalized type and complete MIME/image/optional-position
framing before they can trigger handoff or be forwarded as a shape.

Composition is independent of cursor shape, visibility, and relative-input mode. Native
bitmap notifications change composition only: they do not synthesize a system cursor,
unhide a previously hidden cursor, or change its mode. Existing cursor callbacks retain
their wire format and the predefined system cursor ID 0 hidden/relative rule. When local
composition starts without a known shape, Qt may use its Arrow fallback without replacing
known hidden/relative state. No cursor ABI change is required.

The composition/visibility split and three-second silent-host fallback follow
OpenNOW-Mac revision `666bd4a3391e13b074b37eecfd61d568e9231d34`
(`NativeWebRTCStreamViewCursorVisibility.swift`, `NvstBifrostFreeCursorWatchdog.swift`,
and `NvstRemoteCursor.swift`). OpenNOW retains its existing system-ID mode mapping;
the reference does not provide a verified native bitmap pixel layout.

Qt hides its local stream cursor only while input capture is active and either the
server is compositing or relative input is active; manual unlock retains its local
cursor override. Releasing capture restores the
local cursor on every platform. Accepted session starts reset cached cursor state;
composition callbacks are session-checked and coalesced outside the general bounded
callback queue so telemetry pressure cannot lose the handoff. Window activation
signals are attached for an existing parent window as well as later window changes.

### `0x030d` track remote cursor image

NVB type 8. Same one-byte payload.

```
off  0d 03 01 00 00
on   0d 03 01 00 01
```

Activation sends **on** and leaves it on.

### Type 6 haptics enable

Activation sends remote-input type 13 with body `01 00`, padded and timestamped inside
the type `0x0e` envelope carried by control command `0x0206`. Disabling uses body
`00 00`. The earlier mapping to `0x0322` was incorrect: that command controls cursor
mimic strategy, not haptics.

This mapping follows OpenNOW-Mac revision `666bd4a3391e13b074b37eecfd61d568e9231d34`,
`GFN/NVST/BifrostFree/NvstRemoteInput.swift` (`hapticsState` and `framed`) and
`NvstControlCommand.swift` (`mimicCursorStrategy`). Activation and enable/disable
vectors are checked in `nvst_input.rs`.

### Type 10 mouse settings — no captured frame

What is actually on disk:

- `geronimo.log` / `.bak`: `Sending SDL mouse settings (accel=0, speed=10)` or `Sending alt mouse settings (accel=0, speed=10)`, then `nvbFeatureControl( <heap pointer> )`, then `Update feature type: 10`. The pointer is the client object, not a payload.
- One early-session failure in `geronimo.log.bak`: `Failed to update mouse sensitivity: 10 NVST_R_SUCCESS (0x0)` then `nvbFeatureControl failed for type: 10`. The `10` in that line is the speed value from the format string `Failed to update mouse sensitivity: %d %s (0x%x)` in `Bifrost2.dll`.
- `debug.log`: `Disabling session mouse acceleration` at `QUERY_GFN_START`. No bytes.
- `Geronimo.dll` names: `sendMouseSettings(bool, unsigned int)`, literals `accel=0, speed=10` / `accel=%d, speed=%d`.
- `Bifrost2.dll` names: `Failed to %s feature mouse acceleration`, `NVST_R_SERVER_CONTROL_MOUSE_SETTING_FAILED`. No `runtime.mouseAccel` key. No hex dump format string.

Searched and not present: `.pcap` / `.pcapng` / `.etl` under GFN AppData, Downloads, Documents. No control-frame hex next to type 10 in any `.log` / `.bak`. `snapshot_blob.bin` is V8, not NVST.

There is no byte-exact type 10 frame to copy. OpenNOW currently emits a reconstructed `0x0323` in `nvst_input.rs`. That is not a capture. Leave this section empty until one exists.

## Activation chain

`activation_chain(20102193)` in the same test. Sent on `control_channel_reliable` in this order.

| Step | Code | Hex |
|---|---|---|
| 1. enable input false | `0x020b` | `0b 02 0c 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` |
| 2. device descriptor index 2 | `0x020d` | `0d 02 30 00 23 00 00 00 00 01 32 bc 31 22 0c 00 00 00 1a 00 00 00 02 00 14 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` |
| 3. cursor capture on | `0x0308` | `08 03 01 00 01` |
| 4. track cursor on | `0x030d` | `0d 03 01 00 01` |
| 5. window state 19 | `0x0320` | `20 03 0c 00 00 00 00 00 13 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` |
| 6. system state 0 | `0x0321` | `21 03 0c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00` |
| 7. enable input true | `0x020b` | `0b 02 0c 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 01 00 00 00` |

`0x020b` payload is three LE u32 fields. stream index `0`, counter `1`, enabled `0` then `1`.

`0x0320` / `0x0321` payload is three LE u32 fields. stream index `0`, state, frame `0`. Window state **19** (`13 00 00 00`) is required. All-zero window state leaves the session looking inactive and the server withholds system-cursor mode updates.

The test function currently also inserts a reconstructed mouse-settings command between steps 4 and 5. That step is not listed here. It is not from a capture.

## Other outbound control frames

### Keepalive `0x0200`

Every 3 seconds. `control_keepalive(0)`:

```
00 02 04 00 00 00 00 00
```

### Input version inbound

Handshake is ready when `control_channel_reliable` delivers version 3.

```
0e 02 02 00 03 00
```

That is `0x020e`, length 2, version `3`.

### Relative mouse `0x0206`

Test vector. dx=24, dy=24, timestamp `0x01861330`. Route is `control_channel_partially_reliable`.

```
06 02 28 00 00 00 00 24 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 0a 07 00 00 00 00 18 00 18 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 30 13 86 01 00 00 00 00
```

Inner type is LE u32 `7`. Motion uses one trailing LE timestamp.

### Key down `0x0206`

Test vector. virtual key `0x41`, modifiers `1`, timestamp `0x015b15b1`. Route is reliable.

```
06 02 30 00 00 00 00 2c 0e 00 00 00 00 00 00 12 03 00 00 00 00 41 00 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 b1 15 5b 01 00 00 00 00 b1 15 5b 01 00 00 00 00
```

Keys and absolute mouse get two trailing timestamps.

### Gamepad `0x020d`

First report also sends a device descriptor on reliable control, index **3**. Updates go `input_channel_partially_reliable`.

First update in the test. sequence `1`, buttons `0x1000`, timestamp `0x015b171a`:

```
0d 02 34 00 23 00 00 00 00 01 5b 17 1a 26 00 00 01 22 0c 00 00 00 1a 00 00 00 03 00 14 00 00 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 55 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
```

The inner player index is hardcoded `03`. Slot and bitmap from the 38-byte type-12 packet are not copied.

`INPUT_HAPTICS_ENABLED` uses remote-input type 13 under command `0x0206`, with a
little-endian u16 enable flag and timestamp envelope; see Type 6 haptics enable above.

## Media control, not NVB features

These are QoS and recovery. Same header rule. Tests in `nvst_control.rs`.

| Code | Name | Proven frame or payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0302` | IDR request | `02 03 02 00 00 00` |
| `0x0203` | frame pacing | payload `05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 80 3e 00 00 80 3e 00 00 1a 34 00 00` for frame 1, 16000 µs, 16000 µs error |
| `0x0204` | frame ack | 102-byte payload. Full hex in `frame_ack_places_only_source_pinned_fields` |
| `0x0207` | QoS report | 52-byte payload. Full hex in `qos_report_matches_the_source_test_layout` |

QoS reports run every 50 ms. The sender-authored frame number is at `+12`, interval packet
loss per 10,000 authenticated RTP packets is at `+26`, and `+36` is the client elapsed clock
in 90 kHz ticks, not the sender's RTP timestamp. A failed SCTP queue attempt does not advance
the successful report's sequence or loss baseline; a new session starts fresh. Offsets
`+16`, `+20`, `+24`, `+28`, `+40`, `+44`, and `+48` remain zero because their vendor meanings
are unverified. `+34` is zero in the official v7 builder. Neither completed-frame byte
counts nor RTP interarrival jitter substitute for these fields. Regression coverage in
`nvst_qos_tests.rs` exercises authenticated encrypted reception at synthetic 50/75 Mbps,
partial frames, rejected packets, packet loss, sequence wrap, and report baselines. These
tests cannot establish server-side bitrate adaptation or live-session recovery.

The partial-control sender concatenates frame records and QoS reports within a 1,071-byte
message, flushing on a full batch or after 50 ms. A rejected write retains the exact
bounded batch for retry; only an accepted write advances the QoS interval snapshot.
DESCRIBE's video feedback, timings, and blob-stat version offers flow into the transport
handoff. Offers below the implemented v7/v5/v9 layouts are rejected rather than sending
a newer wire record to an older server. When v5 timings and v9 blob stats are offered,
the client requests pacing mode 2 with feedback mode 0 and stops sending the neutral
`0x0203` report. Missing offers preserve the existing legacy behavior. This does not
claim complete V9 stage timings: its field order and the actual presentation timestamp
boundary still need capture-backed verification.

IDR is the recovery command OpenNOW already sends. Official also sends a reference-invalidation request. That invalidation frame is **not** in this tree and is not guessed here.
Mjolnir video uses private NACK v2 and control IDR, not a second RTCP Receiver Report or PLI.

## Inbound cursor examples

Server `0x010f` system cursor. Tests in `extracts_system_cursor_notifications_from_server_control`.

```
visible id 1     0f 01 09 00 01 00 00 00 0c 80 16 80 01
id 0 lock-style  0f 01 04 00 00 00 00 00
```

Normalized extract for id 1 is `00 01 00 00 00 00 00 0c 80 16 80`. OpenNOW treats type 0 and cursor id 0 as hidden relative.

Cursor extraction walks the little-endian command code and payload length at each
command boundary, as the Mac reference's `NvstControlCommand.parse` does. It skips
non-cursor payloads intact and stops at a truncated command. It must not scan inside
those payloads for cursor-looking bytes: doing so can manufacture lock/unlock
notifications from unrelated traffic. Complete cursor commands before a truncated
tail, and cursor commands following an unrelated complete command, still dispatch.
The `unrelated_control_payloads_cannot_toggle_cursor_lock` and
`truncated_control_payloads_cannot_invent_cursor_notifications` transport tests
exercise these boundaries without a live session.

## What is missing on purpose

- Feature type 10 on-wire bytes. Logs and DLL names prove it is mouse accel/speed. They do not dump the frame.
- Official encoding of type 0 and type 8. OpenNOW’s `0x0308` / `0x030d` match the comments and the session behavior. They are not proven equal to Geronimo’s on-wire feature blob until a capture says so.
- Reference-invalidation bytes.

When you have a capture, put the exact type 10 frame in the section above and pin it with a test. Do not fill it from the log English or from reading the DLL.
